# Odyssey Coding Practice Guidelines:


* Try to divide the problem into as many sub-problems as possible and try to solve all of them. That will ensure effective learning. 

* If you have doubts, use the issues section in the git repo and we will answer them immediately.

1. Participants must have a valid codeforces.com and atcoder.jp login/handle.
1. Each round consists of several problems.
1. Participants will be given 30 Minutes to 180 Minutes to solve these problems.
2. All submissions have to be made to codeforces/atcoder, in the link provided along with the problem itself.
3. The contestants are **forbidden to talk** about subjects, related to the problems, with anybody, including other contestants. They are only allowed to ask questions to the contest organizer.
4. During a practice contest, the contestants can ask questions to the contest organizer. The questions may concern mistakes, ambiguous spots and inaccuracies in the statement.
5. The answer  **"No comments"**  means that the answer to the question is in the problem statement itself and no such clarification is required.
6. An answer to a question is only available to the contestant who has asked it apart from the cases when the contest organizer decides that the question is important for all contestants. In this case the organizer can make the question and the answer to it available to all contestants.
7. Once your solution is **accepted**, immediately inform the organizer for verification and evaluation.
8. Participants will be evaluated based on the following parameters: 
   * Time of Submission (earlier the better)
   * Number of Submissions per Question (lower the better)
   * Number of Failed Tests per Question (lower the better)
   * Time and Space Complexity of the Proposed Solution (lower the better)
   * Time Taken for Execution (lower the better)
   * Memory Utilised (lower the better)
9. If found cheating, the participant will be barred from further contests.
10. In case of discrepancies, **the decision of the organizer will be considered final.**
